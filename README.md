# Biorealms Test API

Hosted simple API, currently in a testing stage, for retrieving a biogeographic realm name, using a country, dependency, or overseas area. Therefore, if you only have a country name, this is what you could use to get biogeographic realm names for it. If you have something more precise, such as latitude and longitude, you would not use this API.

The Global 200/WWF system is used, which can be browsed in a few places, such as:

There is also a handy page here for finding the WWF terrestrial ecoregion that you want:

I expect to overhaul this or eventually abandon it, depending on how capabilities and opportunities change.

For countries that exist in more than one biogeographic realm, I list them both, with the one covering the largest proportion of territory in the country first. The largest proportion of the country covered is often easy to determine, but in a few cases it is not. When two realms cover 50% each, I list the one with major ports first. For countries with overseas departments or states in other realms, I list them separately.

**Edge cases
There is no perfect way to outline biogeographic realms. While most countries are easy to place, a few are more or less difficult.
- Algeria: Many maps seemingly arbitrarily use a mostly straight line or a slight northern bulge to indicate transition in the southern tip to The Sahel, which is treated as Afrotropical. This line intersects some part near the southern corner of Algeria, probably with the intention of depicting part of the Adrar des Ifoghas mountain range, although I prefer to treat Algeria as entirely Palearctic.
