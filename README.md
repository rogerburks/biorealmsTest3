# Biorealms Test API

Hosted simple API, currently in a testing stage, for retrieving a biogeographical realm name, using a country, dependency, or overseas area. Therefore, if you only have a country name, this is what you could use to get biogeographical realm names for it. If you have something more precise, such a latitude and longitude, you would not use this API.

The Global 200/WWF system is used, which can be browsed in a few places, such as:

There is also a handy page here for finding the WWF terrestrial ecoregion that you want:

I expect to overhaul this or eventually abandon it, depending on how capabilities and opportunities change.

For countries that exist in more than one biogeographic realm, I list them both, with the one covering the largest proportion of territory in the country first. This is often easy, but in a few cases it is not. When two realms cover 50% each, I list the one with major ports first. For countries with overseas departments or states in other realms, I list them separately.
